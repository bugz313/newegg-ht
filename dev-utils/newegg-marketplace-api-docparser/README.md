Very dirty parser for the developer guide PDF file. This will go through and extract each method from the PDF. Keep in mind this is very dirty and does barely any "fact checking". I only created this to assist with the creation of the main library.

### Usage

```terminal
node index.js NeweggMarketplaceAPIDeveloperGuide_V3.07.pdf out.json
```
